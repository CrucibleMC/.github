## Crucible MC
Hey there, welcome to Crucible MC â€“ Where we're all about making legacy servers lesser of a pain! Born from a collective of friends annoyed by the pervasive issues found on Thermos, our goal is to sort out those pesky issues for all server owners while innovating with new mods that enhance the overall experience of legacy Minecraft.
Stay in touch with Crucible development, updates and support at our [discord](https://discord.gg/jWSTJ4d).
